 1.I'm in lab week 6!
 
 2. Basic wrangling and make a graph of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy aggression rates
 
```{r}
hp_graph <- hp_data %>%
  filter(Name == "Harry" | Name == "Draco Malfoy") %>%
  select(Name, book, agg.per.mention) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= book, y=agg.per.mention)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill=Name), position= "dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw()

hp_graph
```

CLUSTER COLUMN GRAPH (next hw)
 
 default for geom column with mult groups tiny narrow lines in each column ( want to sepearte this)
stacked column graphs are almost always garbage = cluster is better (put next to eachother)
